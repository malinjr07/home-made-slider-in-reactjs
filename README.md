# A Home Made Sync Slider in ReactJs/NextJs

## Following the Slick Slider Concept

**It's interesting**

<i>In my Opinion</i> The Slider is one of the most demanding yet most painful part of Front-End Development. To be honest, most of the slider's functions goes over developers head. We simply follow, <b> As long as it's working, keep using </b>

### No Extra/3rd party Library has used

**As I mention Before** No packages satisfied me, so I just built this one in Reactjs, Tailwind CSS

### But You have used Next.js Cheater!

Becuase, even Reactjs suggest to use Next.js for Server-Side Projects. And as a developer, we all know, **Most of the projects are connected with server, and has complex UI**. So, I have just used the Framework on top of React.

### But Hey don't worry, I haven't used any Server-Side Feature of Next.js

The Codes are completely client-side. (_useEffect hook_) Which any developer has learned as a begineer of ReactJs journey.
